# WEC-REC Inventory Barcode App

A lightweight inventory management app for small sellers, built with **Flutter** (mobile), **Flask** (backend), and **SQLite/Postgres**.  
Track products, receive and dispatch items with barcodes, and get low-stock alertsâ€”all with a minimal, reliable workflow.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication:**  
  Secure login/signup with JWT. Each user sees only their own products and items.

- **Product Management:**  
  - Add products with name, description, image, and low-stock threshold.
  - Images are uploaded and displayed in the app.

- **Receiving Items:**  
  - Receive (add) single items to a product.
  - Each received item generates a unique barcode (QR/Code128) encoding `{userId|productId|itemId}`.
  - Barcode preview and save/print option.

- **Dispatching Items:**  
  - Scan barcode to dispatch (remove) a single item.
  - Prevents double-dispatch via item status check.

- **Low-Stock Alerts:**  
  - Set per-product thresholds.
  - Get alerts when stock falls below threshold.
